                This is my 4th year in robotics, I am very happy as every year I learn new things. This year I was able to help a little bit with the robot design, the kiosk, our video, our T-shirts and with journalism, all while trying to manage meetings and the budget.
                We have a wonderful team this year and I am blessed to be part of it.

                First year in the club and my first experience in a robotics competition. Working in the club gave me the opportunity to gain knowledge in the conception of a robot and in discovering new softwares. Also, I got to meet wonderful people, that I’m happy
                to call friends, with whom I can have a laugh while working on an enormous project. I was also able to use my creative side to help creating the web site and the video.

                First year in the robotics club and in fact, the first time in a club. Being part of this huge project enabled me to enhance my skills on the human and teamwork levels. I took a big part not only in the assembling of the kiosk, particularly on the control
                panel, but also on the robot on a mechanical and structural level, and lastly, on the video.

                This year, like all the other years I was involved in the robotic team, either as a participant or a mentor, I am still amazed how this activity can bring these young people together and achieve big things. From the conception of the robot to the painting
                of the making of the video, I'm there to advise them and keep them out of trouble.

                On the other hand, stress is an excellent way of forming friendships.

                time of my life working with this team on that project.
