            Game description
        </p>
        <p style="line-height: 25px;">The objective is to score the most points possible in 5 minutes. Two teams of two will compete in a rectangular arena with their robots. The teams will be identified by colors, either yellow or blue. To score a point, a sand pocket must go in
            the team’s basket, but the robot can’t touch the sand pockets. A conveyor belt will be responsible of carrying the sand pockets. A device will be in charge of releasing the pockets on the conveyor belt . Since the teams can’t touch the conveyor
            nor the sand pockets, they can only change the outcome of the game by using the bonus activator that will act on the distribution device or the conveyor belt. The first four activator are splitted, so there’s four assigned to the yellow team
            and four assigned to the blue team. The first activator the teams need to activate is the hinged plate which will activate the sand pocket distributor which will let the sand pockets fall on regular interval. At that moment, the conveyor belt
            will turn for 30 seconds in the direction of the team that activated the hinged plate first and in the other direction. After a minute, the teams can activate the hinged plate again, but the bonus can only be activated once during the game,
            it will change the direction of the conveyor belt. The wrecking ball increases the speed of the pockets distribution
